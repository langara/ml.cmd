ml.cmd
======

Collection of my custom commands to use either as shell commands or as python functions.

I try to use ipython as a bash replacement more, so I've rewritten some of my custom
scripts in a way to be available from different levels:
- traditional shell (like bash or sh)
- python shell (like ipython or bpython)
- python scripts (like qtile config file)

This script is not really prepared to run on other systems than mine.
If you want to use it, first you should review and adjust the content of cmd.py file.
